<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details. -->

## Overview
I want to create a simple but attractive game that doubles as a learning tool and teaches me how to use Next.js. It's a win-win, killing two birds with one stone.

## The challenge
Users should be able to:

## My Process
1 Nov 2023:
I took a long break from this project to focus on actively job searching, but now am in the mood to get this going again. Last I checked, I was having issues displaying data from a local file. I figured out that the fetch method only works for fetching data from a server, which I did not bother to set up since my dummy data is a very small JSON file. In the future, I may change this as my data grows and use Node and Express to set up a local server. Instead, I came across this info from the Next.js docs: https://vercel.com/guides/loading-static-file-nextjs-api-route, which satisfies my current needs. I needed to import the file system library into my cards page server component. From there I was able to asynchronously call to fetch json data from the same project directory. From there I passed the data on to the 'Question' UI component to dynamically render random card data everytime the page reloads. Again, lots to think about here such as:
  1. making sure that each card question cycles through only once
  2. toggle the 'show hint' button
  3. create a mechanism to stop the quiz when all cards have been displayed

Still, really enjoying learning how to use Next.js!



### Built with

<!-- ## The challenge -->
<!-- There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS! -->

<!-- You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go. -->
<!-- Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page (currently in progress) -->

<!-- Want some support on the challenge? [Join our community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community) and ask questions in the **#help** channel. -->

<!-- ## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts. -->

<!-- ## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommended hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

You can host your site using one of these solutions or any of our other trusted providers. [Read more about our recommended and trusted hosts](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe). -->

<!-- ## Create a custom `README.md`

We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one. We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code.

The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you like.

Once you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`. That will make it show up as your repository's README file.

## Submitting your solution
